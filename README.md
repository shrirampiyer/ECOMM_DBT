📝 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an efficient and secure data pipeline for processing e-commerce data. The pipeline ingests data into AWS S3, treats it as an external stage in Snowflake, and then uses DBT to transform, cleanse, and load the data into Snowflake tables.

🛠️ Architecture

The pipeline follows these steps:

Data Ingestion: E-commerce data is ingested into AWS S3.

External Stage: S3 is treated as an external stage in Snowflake.

DBT Transformation: Data is loaded from the external stage into Snowflake and transformed using DBT models.

Data Quality Assurance: DBT test cases ensure data integrity by checking for nulls, accepted values, and duplicates.

Data Masking: Sensitive PII information is protected using Snowflake's masking policies.

Analytics: The cleansed and transformed data is analyzed directly within Snowflake.

🧰 Technologies Used

DBT (Data Build Tool)

Snowflake

AWS S3

Python (optional for scripts and automation)

🚀 Setup Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

cd ecommerce-data-pipeline

Install DBT:

Follow the DBT installation guide.

Configure DBT Profile:

Set up your DBT profile to connect to Snowflake by editing the profiles.yml file.

Set Up Snowflake External Stage:

Ensure your AWS S3 bucket is configured as an external stage in Snowflake.

Run DBT Models:

Execute the DBT models to transform and load data:

bash

dbt run

Run DBT Tests:

Validate the data integrity:

bash

dbt test

📈 Data Flow

Data Ingestion: Raw data is ingested into an AWS S3 bucket.

External Stage: The S3 bucket is referenced as an external stage in Snowflake.

Transformation: DBT models transform and cleanse the data.

Loading: The transformed data is loaded into Snowflake tables.

Analytics: Perform analytics on the cleansed data in Snowflake.

🛡️ Data Quality

Data quality is ensured through DBT test cases that:

Check for null values.

Validate accepted value ranges.

Identify duplicates.

🔒 Security & Data Masking

To protect sensitive PII information, masking policies are applied in Snowflake. This ensures that data is both secure and compliant with privacy regulations.

📊 Analytics

The transformed data is analyzed directly within Snowflake, enabling insights that drive decision-making for the e-commerce business.
